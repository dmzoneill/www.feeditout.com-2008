    <plot>
        When Alison Scott is promoted in E! Television, she goes to a night-club to celebrate with her 
        older married sister Debbie. Alison meets the pothead reckless Ben Stone and while having a small 
        talk with Ben, Debbie's husband Pete calls her to tell that their daughter has chicken pots. 
        Debbie leaves the place but Allison stays with Ben, drinking and dancing along all night; 
        completely wasted, they end up having a one night stand. Ben does not use condom and eight 
        weeks later, Allison discovers that she is pregnant. She calls Ben and they decide to try to 
        stay together and have the baby. However, Ben needs to grow-up first to raise a family of his own. 
        Written by Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
        
        A one night stand turns into the unexpected for Ben, when Alison announces to him that she is 
        now pregnant with his child. Ben decides that the best thing to do is to get his life sorted 
        so he can care for Alison and his new child, which isn't an easy job for him.
