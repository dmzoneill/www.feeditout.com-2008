    <plot>
        At Super Club, a large warehouse store, the employees strive to obtain the &quot;Employee of the Month&quot;
        award with the benefits of having their picture featured on the wall of fame in the staff lounge. 
        Zack Bradley, a box boy, and Vince Downey, a cashier, are two competitive Super Club employees. 
        Vince has become head cashier of the store and winner of seventeen consecutive &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; awards. 
        Zack, on the other hand, is a slacker but is popular with his colleagues. &#10;&#10;         
        
        Zack has not won any &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; awards and has no desire to except when Amy, 
        a new cashier who only dates &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; winners, transfers to the store. 
        Zack and Vince compete to get Amy's attention through competition and courtship. 
        Vince attempts to impress Amy with skills as a cashier and his seventeen &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; awards, 
        while Zack attempts to use several methods of charm and comedy to win her affection. After realizing that 
        Amy is falling for Vince, Zack believes his only chance to get her is to win Super Club's next &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; award.
