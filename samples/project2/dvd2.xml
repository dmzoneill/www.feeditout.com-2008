    <plot>
        Seth and Evan are best friends, inseparable, navigating the last weeks of high school. 
        Usually shunned by the popular kids, Seth and Evan luck into an invitation to a party, 
        and spend a long day, with the help of their nerdy friend Fogell, trying to score enough alcohol
        to lubricate the party and inebriate two girls, Jules and Becca, so they can kick-start their 
        sex lives and go off to college with a summer full of experience and new skills. 
        Their quest is complicated by Fogell's falling in with two inept cops who both slow and assist the plan.
        If they do get the liquor to the party, what then? Is sex the only rite of passage at hand? Written by {jhailey@hotmail.com}
        
        Seth, Evan and Fogell are three teenage guys who love to drink and desperately wish to get laid. 
        When a girl that Seth really likes, asks him to get the drink for her party, 
        he sees this as a perfect opportunity to make her his girlfriend. 
        The trio plan out how to get the alcohol, even including Fogell's new fake ID, but things won't
        got smoothly for the trio. Seth and Evan become separated from Fogell (now called McLovin) and
        they still haven't got the alcohol for the party that night.
