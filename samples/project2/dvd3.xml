        Viktor Navorski, a man from an Eastern European country arrives in New York. 
        However after he left his country war broke out. Suddenly Navorski is a man without a country - 
        or one that the U.S. cannot recognize, thus he is denied entrance to the U.S. However, 
        he also can't be deported so he is told by the Security Manager that he has to remain 
        in the airport until his status can be fixed. And also Navorski doesn't speak English very well, 
        so he cannot talk to or understand anyone. But he somehow adapts and sets up residence 
        in the airport, which makes the man who placed him there unhappy, as it seems he is in line 
        for a promotion but Navroski's presence might complicate that. So he tries to get Navorski to 
        leave but Navorski remains where he is. Navorski makes friends with some of the people who work 
        in the airport and is attracted to a flight attendant he runs into whenever she comes in.

        An Eastern European visitor becomes a resident of a New York airport terminal when a war 
        breaks out and erases his country from the map, voiding his passport. He makes friends 
        with the airport staff and falls in love with a flight attendant. Written by BGW Claw
        
        Former Krakozhian Viktor Navorski is almost in New York City for the first time in his life. 
        "Former" and "almost"?: while Viktor is flying to JFK Airport, Krakozhia has been overthrown 
        as a country with no nation recognizing the new regime, therefore all government papers 
        such as passports, visas and currency issued by Krakozhia are also not recognized 
        internationally. With only these papers in hand when Viktor arrives at JFK, he is not allowed 
        entry into the United States. All air service in and out of Krakozhia has been suspended 
        and thus Viktor cannot even be sent back until Krakozhia's situation is resolved. 
        Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection at JFK, allows Viktor to stay 
        in the international lounge until the problem is resolved. Dixon gives Viktor enough meal 
        vouchers to last for a day or two, with Dixon expecting Viktor to secretly escape the lounge 
        into the outside world. Viktor, however, wants to be as proper as possible and decides to 
        stay in the lounge. Viktor poses a problem for Dixon, as Viktor may be the black mark in 
        his promotion to head of the department. Their relationship becomes an antagonistic one, 
        where Dixon will now do whatever he can to prevent Viktor from ever entering the country 
        even if he ever did learn the heartbreaking reason for Viktor's visit. 
        As Viktor stays in the lounge, he only has limited resources on which to live and a 
        limited understanding of the English language. Viktor's encounters with lounge employees 
        is also initially antagonistic, but they all learn to live in harmony and friendship as 
        Viktor's stay increases. The one person Viktor would like to meet and know is United Airlines 
        flight attendant Amelia Warren, who is in transit through JFK every few weeks and who seems to 
        be dealing with her own personal demons.
